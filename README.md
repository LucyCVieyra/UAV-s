# UAV-s
This is a code in HTML ans CSS that I've been working on these days. It was my fitst project in HTML :)
The code defines a sleek webpage introducing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It incorporates consistent fonts, a calming background, and rounded image borders. The content covers UAV topics, types, and applications, complemented by a user-friendly form for feedback.
